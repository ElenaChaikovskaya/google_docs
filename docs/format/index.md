A well formatted document is consistent, correct, and easy to read.

The visual appeal of a document has an effect on the reader and how they perceive the information. That is why, itâ€™s important in any piece of writing or documentation to be concerned with the text formatting. Formatting also makes information more accessible to the reader by creating and labeling sections (headings), highlighting key words or ideas (bold, italics, or lists), and making a good impression (professional look and feel, appropriate font choice for the document type).
